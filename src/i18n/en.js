      "My career began in CRM and email development, where I worked daily with project managers, designers, and engineering teams to solve technical problems, structure projects, and deliver high-impact, data-driven components used by thousands of users. This experience strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, problem-solving mindset, and ability to work in global and dynamic environments. The transition to the world of data has been a natural evolution for me. Today, I work with SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, and I develop projects focused on data cleansing, visualization, and analysis. I enjoy transforming raw information into something clear, useful, and valuable. I am motivated to learn, develop, and contribute to teams that rely on data for decision-making. If you are looking for someone analytical, curious, structured, and committed, I would love to connect with you.",
